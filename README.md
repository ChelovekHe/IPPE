# IPPE
Infinitesimal Plane-based Pose Estimation (IPPE): A very fast method to compute a camera's pose from a single image of a planar object using point correspondences. This has uses in several applications, including augmented reality, 3D tracking & pose estimation with planar markers, and 3D scene understanding.

This is the author's implementation from the peer reviewed paper "Infinitesimal Plane-based Pose Estimation" by Toby Collins and Adrien Bartoli, published in the International Journal of Computer Vision, September 2014.
